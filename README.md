## Don't be afraid to ask questions 😊

## Principles of this course

1. There are no bonuses.
2. You learn as much as you want.
3. Be proactive.
4. Each task will have a solution uploaded - it's not expected that yours should match it. The solution is there to serve as an example. Focus on making the test cases match (where randomness is excluded, of course).
5. Using generative AI is discouraged. Instead, try to research via Google on your own and read documentations of various libraries. You can also ask me, of course.
6. Using generative AI to solve the tasks, given in this course, is strongly discouraged.

## Frequently asked questions

### How will I be graded?

There will be two homeworks, a project and a possible theory exam.

### Who has more information about the theory exam?

Refer to the lead of the course.

### When will project topics be provided?

Two weeks before the end of the semester.
