## Set up an environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks

Please follow the instructions in one of the following two folders:

1. [GuideForVisualStudioCode](./GuideForVisualStudioCode/) - for working in a local development environment (**recommended by Simo**).

### Books

- If you are part of the Moodle class, you should have received more information about recommended books by Simo at the start of the semester.
- If you are part of the Moodle class, but haven't received anything, feel free to contact Simo via his email address.

## Don't be afraid to ask questions ðŸ˜Š

> He who asks a question is a fool **for five minutes**; he who does not ask a question remains a fool **forever**.

-- Chinese Proverb

## Principles of this course

1. You learn as much as you want.
2. Be proactive.
3. Using generative AI is discouraged. Instead, try to research via Google on your own and read documentations of various libraries. You can also ask me, of course.
4. Using generative AI to solve the tasks, given in this course, is strongly discouraged.
5. We may not have enough time to go through all the planned material for each session. In such cases, please read the remainder on your own.
6. You'll get the solution of a task if you first try to solve it yourself.

## Frequently asked questions

### How will I be graded?

There will be two homeworks, a project and a discussion. No exams are planned.

### What is "the discussion"?

- The discussion is done after the defense of the project on the date of the final exam.
- It forms **50%** of the final grade.
- If I'm available to tune in for the final, I'll be asking questions (some will be in an interview style) regarding the topics I've covered.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me everything you know about boosting?
  - How can we deal with missing values?
  - What's an important step to do when splitting data for a classification problem?
- The complexity of the questions will be inversely proportional to the number of submitted "For Home" weeks. More submissions => easier questions (from my side).
  - I'll ask no questions if all "For Home" weeks are submitted.

### Who has more information about the theory exam?

There will be no theory exam(s).

### When will project topics be provided?

Two weeks before the end of the semester.

### Can I submit my own project idea?

Yes. I'll let you know when there's a submission form for that. Note that in order for you to start working on your idea, it has to be approved by us.
