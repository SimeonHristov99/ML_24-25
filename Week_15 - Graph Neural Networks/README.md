# ðŸŽ¯ Goals for week 15

1. Practice working with graph neural networks.
2. Practice working with automated machine learning with PyCaret.

## Task 01

Define a graph neural network that classifies nodes using [the `MUTAG` dataset](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/2.6.0/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.TUDataset.html#torch_geometric.datasets.TUDataset).

## Task 02

Use PyCaret to solve `hw1` and `hw2`.
